## Todo

- Set up trello board
- Create trigger prefab component for events, could import script from Netrunner
- Bake lighting properly with intel cpu
- Ambient sound/SFX
- Main menu (Start, Options, Quit)
- Settings menu (Resolution, Fullscreen, Volume, Keybinds, etc.)
- Build proper story/plot (Reason why the player is here and why things are happening)
